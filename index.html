          As two fallen people who are blood-bought servants of King Jesus, we declare His Kingdom as our purpose, foundation, and eager hope. We may be weak and fail, but God is our strength and portion forever.</p>

          Rach and I met on June 9, 2016 at a random gathering of soon-to-be friends. Our friendship quickly blossomed over coffee, outdoor activities, silly jokes, and even some trying times. Health issues, broken trust, and financial uncertainty are only some of the difficulties we encountered as we embarked on a 2.5-year courtship. I've found Rach to be a selfless helper, kind friend, wise example, loving perseverer, passionate partner in ministry, and more. Countless times has she counseled me with the wisdom of the Lord and the treasure of his Gospel. In marrying Rach, I gain an enduring friend who will faithfully challenge me to walk the Lord's narrow road and join me happily along the way, even through the Valley. An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.

          In Jar I have found a true friend and Christian brother. I knew early on in our friendship that I wanted him in my life for the long haul. Though we have faced many trials and the effects of one another’s sin, he has continually pointed me back to Christ, and fought to help me place the Gospel at the forefront of my heart. I rejoice knowing that he is not afraid to bring me face to face with my sin. I see his love for me as such a clear picture of Jesus’s love in my life. I have and will fail him, and yet, he does not leave. Instead he continues to shower me with his gracious love, and fight to see me become the woman God has created me to be. And it motivates me to do the same for him.
